  sharpe: {
    term: "Sharpe Ratio",
    def: "Measures risk-adjusted return: how much excess return you earn per unit of risk taken.",
    formula: "Sharpe = (Portfolio Return - Risk-free Rate) / Standard Deviation",
    example: "Portfolio earned 12%, risk-free rate 6.5%, std dev 8%, so Sharpe is 0.69. Above 1 is generally good.",
    why: "Compares strategies with different risk levels. A 15% return with high volatility may be worse than 10% with low volatility.",
    related: "Alpha | Beta | Drawdown",
  },
  pe: {
    term: "P/E Ratio",
    def: "Price-to-earnings ratio. Shows how much investors pay per unit of earnings.",
    formula: "P/E = Market Price per Share / Earnings per Share",
    example: "A NIFTY 50 trailing P/E near 22 means investors pay about Rs. 22 for Rs. 1 of earnings.",
    why: "Core valuation tool that helps identify if a stock is cheap or expensive versus peers or its own history.",
    related: "P/B Ratio | EPS | Market Cap",
  },
  beta: {
    term: "Beta",
    def: "Measures how much a stock moves relative to the market. Beta above 1 means more volatile than market.",
    formula: "Beta = Covariance(Stock, Market) / Variance(Market)",
    example: "HDFC Bank beta near 0.85 means if NIFTY falls 10%, HDFC may fall about 8.5%.",
    why: "Essential for portfolio construction because high-beta stocks amplify both gains and losses.",
    related: "Alpha | Volatility | Correlation",
  },
  alpha: {
    term: "Alpha",
    def: "Excess return generated above the benchmark after adjusting for risk.",
    formula: "Alpha = Portfolio Return - [Risk-free Rate + Beta x (Market Return - Risk-free Rate)]",
    example: "Benchmark returned 10% and your portfolio returned 13% with similar risk, so alpha is about 3%.",
    why: "The ultimate measure of skill versus luck. Consistent positive alpha is rare and highly valued.",
    related: "Sharpe Ratio | Beta | Benchmark",
  },
  drawdown: {
    term: "Drawdown",
    def: "The peak-to-trough decline in portfolio value over a period.",
    formula: "Drawdown = (Trough Value - Peak Value) / Peak Value x 100",
    example: "Portfolio peaked at Rs. 12,000 then fell to Rs. 9,600, so drawdown is -20%.",
    why: "Crucial risk metric. Managing drawdown prevents panic-selling at the bottom.",
    related: "Volatility | Risk Management | Rebalancing",
  },
  diversification: {
    term: "Diversification",
    def: "Spreading investments across assets, sectors, or geographies to reduce unsystematic risk.",
    formula: "Portfolio variance depends on weights, volatility, and correlation across holdings.",
    example: "Holding IT ETF, Pharma ETF, and Govt Bond ETF means a tech downturn will not wipe your portfolio.",
    why: "Reduces volatility without proportionally reducing returns when assets are not perfectly correlated.",
    related: "Correlation | Beta | Sector Rotation",
  },
  nav: {
    term: "NAV",
    def: "Net asset value is the total value of a fund or portfolio after subtracting liabilities.",
    formula: "NAV = (Assets - Liabilities) / Units Outstanding",
    example: "If a fund owns Rs. 10 crore of assets and has 10 lakh units, NAV is Rs. 100 per unit.",
    why: "NAV helps track portfolio value over time and compare performance before and after cash flows.",
    related: "Portfolio Value | Benchmark | Return",
  },
  duration: {
    term: "Duration",
    def: "Measures a bond portfolio's sensitivity to interest-rate changes.",
    formula: "Approx price change = -Duration x Change in yield",
    example: "A bond with duration 5 may fall about 5% if yields rise by 1 percentage point.",
    why: "Duration is central for fixed-income risk because higher duration means higher rate sensitivity.",
    related: "Yield | Interest Rate Risk | Bonds",
  },
  yield: {
    term: "Yield",
    def: "The income return earned from an investment, usually shown as a percentage of price.",
    formula: "Dividend Yield = Annual Dividend / Current Price",
    example: "A stock paying Rs. 5 annual dividend at Rs. 100 price has a 5% dividend yield.",
    why: "Yield helps compare income opportunities, but high yield can also signal higher risk.",
    related: "Coupon | Dividend | Total Return",
  },
  volatility: {
    term: "Volatility",
    def: "Measures how much returns move around their average. Higher volatility means wider price swings.",
    formula: "Volatility is commonly measured as standard deviation of returns.",
    example: "A portfolio moving +/- 3% daily is more volatile than one moving +/- 0.8% daily.",
    why: "Volatility affects drawdowns, position sizing, and whether a return is worth the risk taken.",
    related: "Sharpe Ratio | Drawdown | Risk",
  },
  correlation: {
    term: "Correlation",
    def: "Measures how closely two assets move together, from -1 to +1.",
    formula: "Correlation = Covariance(Asset A, Asset B) / (Std A x Std B)",
    example: "If tech stocks often rise and fall together, their correlation is high.",
    why: "Low or negative correlation can reduce portfolio risk through diversification.",
    related: "Diversification | Beta | Portfolio Variance",
  },
  benchmark: {
    term: "Benchmark",
    def: "A reference index or portfolio used to judge performance, such as NIFTY 50, S&P 500, SPY, or QQQ.",
    formula: "Excess Return = Portfolio Return - Benchmark Return",
    example: "If your portfolio returns 12% and the benchmark returns 8%, excess return is 4%.",
    why: "Benchmarks show whether returns came from skill, market movement, or taking a different type of risk.",
    related: "Alpha | Tracking Error | Relative Return",
